## Troubleshooting

#### Steamdeck unstable connection

The HHKB Professional Hybrid + Steam Deck combo can definitely have Bluetooth quirks. Here are some solutions to try:

**Steam Deck specific fixes:**

- Make sure you're in Desktop Mode when pairing initially - Gaming Mode can be finicky with keyboards
- After pairing in Desktop Mode, switch to Gaming Mode and test
- Try turning off Steam Input for the keyboard in controller settings

**HHKB-specific troubleshooting:**

- Reset the HHKB's Bluetooth: Hold Fn + Q + Tab for 3 seconds to clear pairing history
- Make sure the keyboard is in the right mode - Fn + Control + 1/2/3/4 to switch between connection slots
- Try pairing to a different slot (the HHKB can remember 4 devices)

**General Bluetooth improvements:**

- Clear Steam Deck's Bluetooth cache: In Desktop Mode, go to System Settings > Bluetooth, remove the keyboard, restart, then re-pair
- Keep the devices closer during initial pairing
- Make sure both devices are fully charged - low battery can cause connection instability

**If still having issues:**

- Try using the USB-C cable occasionally to "refresh" the connection
- Some users report better stability by turning off other Bluetooth devices nearby
- The 2.4GHz USB receiver (if you have the Type-S model) might be more stable than Bluetooth

The HHKB generally has solid Bluetooth, so it's likely a Steam Deck compatibility thing. The Desktop Mode pairing trick usually does the job.
