# Agent Guidelines for Learning Lab

## Project Overview
This is a public learning repository documenting tech experiments, hardware troubleshooting, and infrastructure setup. It serves as a learning journal with practical guides and documented failures.

## Repository Structure
```
lab/
├── hardware/          # Hardware documentation and troubleshooting
├── infrastructure/     # Server setup, deployment guides  
├── experiments/        # Tech experiments and explorations
└── README.md          # Main navigation and introduction
```

## Build/Test/Lint Commands
No automated build, test, or lint tools are configured - this is a documentation repository.

## Content Guidelines
- **Documentation style**: Clear, conversational Markdown with practical examples
- **File naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `vps-setup.md`)
- **Structure**: Organize by topic with READMEs in each directory
- **Learning focus**: Document process, failures, and lessons learned
- **Beginner-friendly**: Include command explanations and troubleshooting sections

## Writing Standards
- Write in first person when documenting personal experiences
- Include timestamps for hardware logs and setup records  
- Add code block language identifiers for syntax highlighting
- Use practical examples over theoretical explanations
- Document both successes and failures for authentic learning

## Repository Philosophy
This is a "lab" for experimentation and learning in public. Embrace documentation of the journey, mistakes, and iterative improvements rather than polished final products.
