# VLAN
- any [[broadcast domain]] that is partitioned and isolated at the [[Data Link Layer]]
	- split an L2 segments and isolate it from other VLANs
- Usually created by tagging Ethernet frames of a single L2 segment with an integer ID (VIDs), each ID forming a separate (sub)[[broadcast domain]] 
- Frames with different IDs belong to a different network. This separates physically linked network.
- VLANs split a single [[L2 segment]] into multiple [[L2 segments]]
