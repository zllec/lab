So far what i understood:

- Before computers are connected in one shared coaxial cable. This means:
  - one computer transmits a frame, everyone will get it
  - if one or more computer transmits a frame, collision occurs
  - L1 segment forms a single collision domain
  - Coax became repeater hub, still singe collision domain
  - hubs became network switch (bridge)
  - nowadays, network switch (bridge) and Layer 2 switch (switch) together with L3 router are combined into one hardware called "switch" and this "switch" has a corresponding virtual device called "Linux bridge" that can do bridging, switching, and routing
- [[L2 segment]]
- [[VLAN]]
- [[L3 segment]]
- [[VXLAN]]
