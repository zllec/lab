# Kubernetes Learning ðŸš¢

My journey learning Kubernetes from the ground up, starting with local development and working towards production concepts.

## Learning Path

### Day 1 - Local Development
- **[Minikube Basics](./01-minikube-basics.md)** - Installation, first cluster, core concepts (Pods, Deployments, Services)

### Coming Next
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Persistent Volumes and Storage
- Multi-container Pods
- Networking deep dive
- Kubernetes The Hard Way
