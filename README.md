# Learning Lab 🧪

> A collection of learning notes, experiments, and documented failures in tech

This repository is my public learning journal where I document everything from hardware troubleshooting to infrastructure setup. The goal is to learn in public and help others who might encounter similar challenges.

## 📖 What's Inside

### 🖥️ Hardware
- **[HHKB Professional Hybrid Type-S](./hardware/hhkb/)** - Battery logs, troubleshooting, and Steam Deck compatibility notes

### 🚀 Infrastructure  
- **[VPS Setup Guide](./infrastructure/vps/)** - First-time VPS configuration with security best practices

### 🔬 Experiments
*Coming soon - various tech experiments and explorations*

## 💡 Philosophy

This is a "lab" for failures, mistakes, and broken things. I believe in:

- **Learning in public** - Sharing both successes and failures
- **Practical documentation** - Real-world solutions over theoretical knowledge  
- **Beginner-friendly explanations** - Breaking down complex topics
- **Process over perfection** - Documenting the journey, not just the destination
